### What is Project Treble, GSI, etc?
Here's [[Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)]]

### Device List
Devices where someone has claimed to have successfully booted a version of phh's generic system image are recorded here.  The level of hardware support (e.g. Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth...) may vary; please refer to the device-specific page for comments on hardware support.

**Device testers/maintainers:**  In addition to hardware support information, please record or give a pointer to at least one known-good factory-image/system-image configuration in a device-specific page (i.e. when a system image successfully boots on your device, please let others know what system image you used and what factory image you flashed over top of, and also any special flashing instructions).  There is a device-specific wiki template here:  [[New-Devices-Template-WIP]].

**ROMs:** Check available GSI ROMs here [[Generic System Image (GSI) list]]

**How to build a GSI?** : Check this guide here [[How to build a GSI?]]

**How to create a device overlay?** : Check this guide here [[How to create an overlay?]]

**Why should I use GSI for A/B devices to some A-only devices?** : On Android 9, Google changed the requirements and all devices shipped with Android 9 must use "[system-as-root](https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/partitions/system-as-root)". Before this change, only A/B devices were system-as-root and GSI name was separated by A-only and A/B. For this historical reasons, you have to use GSI for A/B on the devices shipped with Android 9+.

Since the original device list is pretty long, all supported devices list are now categorized by brand. If you can't see your device's brand here, it might be placed at **Miscellaneous** page.
